# jQuery_Side_Navbar
 First time using jQuery! Created a toggle navbar with toggle items. Each nav item contains sub items that appear and disappear based on which nav item you click on. Followed Animation with JavaScript and jQuery by UC Davis / Coursera. Changed the page layout and made the navigation itself toggle with the use of a button.
